Pixy USB .NET library

I put together the Pixy USB .NET library to make it easier to communicate with the PixyCam over USB.

I included a sample application to show usage. I don't have much experience in C/C++, so I've hacked my way through it. Please excuse poor C/C++ code/style.
This library is also still in progress. I'm currently working on additional commands as well as writing code to retrieve images from the camera.

I'll take any help I can get! Thanks for looking!
